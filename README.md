Map-Score
=========

Collaboratively assessing government interactive maps

#### Proposal

We identify 10 (+/-) characteristics of an online map that we care about, and set up a Google Form. Then we invite everyone to rate maps as they come out, and publish the aggregate ratings.

A score out of 10 (or 100, or whatever) is easy to talk about. And as cities make improvements, we can re-score their maps. Could produce a nice end of year report card, is highly portable to other cities, etc.

The score is a neat way to promote the principles of good engagement maps -- in order to do the scoring, you have to be familiar with all the best practices that the scoring rewards.

## Possible scoring criteria

Imagine each of these is worth 1 point. 

Not every map will be able to score 100% -- there might be desirable characteristics for a map that aren't possible given the data/other issues. (Perhaps?)

### How open is the map data?

* underlying data is accessible for download
* data is accessible in a non-proprietary data format (csv/geojson not GDB)
* data powering the map is directly pulled from an open data site via API (ideal)

### Design

* responsive template
* color-blind friendly (reds/greens)

### Data truthiness

* normalized by area
* available at different geographic roundups (e.g. district)
* available as the original dots (e.g. geocoded location of 311 reports)
